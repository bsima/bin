Create a ~/.deskrc file like so:

    [desk]
    location = ~/desk

    [work.git]
    remote = git@github.com/user/repo.git
    local = repo

    [work.git]
    remote = git@github.com/user/other.git
    local = other-repo

    [work.command]
    name = clock in
    exec = echo i $(date) > ~/.timelog

    [work.env]
    PATH = /whatever
    EDITOR = vim

    [work.command]
    name = block some websites
    exec = echo 'twitter.com 127.0.0.1' > /etc/hosts
    sudo = true

    [home.command]
    name = start media server
    exec = plex start # or whatever


The command 'desk work' will provision the 'work' environment for you, as well
as track your current state. Think of this like 'clocking in' to work. You could
also do 'desk home' and it would provision the 'home' environment. These are
meant to be *soft environments*.

The command 'desk clear' will attempt to close out all your existing work. It
will:

- Do a 'git status' on all 'work' projects to see if you have any unpushed changes
   - If so, fail and tell you where to save/push
   - If not, remove all the git repos
- Clock out of your work

This creates a clean separation of work, a nice way to close out whatever you're
working on for the day.
